Welcome, team! To keep our project organized and our Git history clean, please follow these simple guidelines when you contribute code.

### ## Step-by-Step Workflow

1.  **Create a Branch:** Never push directly to the `main` branch. Always create a new branch for your feature or bugfix.
2.  **Make Your Changes:** Write your code and test it.
3.  **Commit Your Work:** Write a clear and descriptive commit message.
4.  **Push Your Branch:** Push your branch to the central repository.
5.  **Create a Pull Request (PR):** Open a pull request from your branch to the `main` branch for code review.

### ## Branch Naming Convention

Please name your branches using this format: `type/short-description`

* **`feature/`**: For adding a new feature (e.g., `feature/user-login-form`).
* **`fix/`**: For fixing a bug (e.g., `fix/navbar-alignment-issue`).
* **`docs/`**: For changes to documentation (e.g., `docs/update-readme`).

### ## Commit Message Guidelines

We use a convention for our commit messages. This helps us understand the project's history at a glance.

Each commit message should have the format: `type: description`

**Common Types:**

* **`feat`**: A new feature for the user.
* **`fix`**: A bug fix for the user.
* **`style`**: Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc).
* **`refactor`**: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.
* **`docs`**: Changes to the documentation.
* **`test`**: Adding or fixing tests.

**Examples:**

* `feat: Add user registration API endpoint`
* `fix: Correct password validation logic`
* `docs: Update setup instructions in README`
* `style: Format server.js with Prettier`
